# StrokePredNN

Neural-network baseline for stroke prediction using the Healthcare Stroke dataset.

## Contents
- `strokeprednn.ipynb` - data prep, model training, and evaluation
- `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv` - source dataset

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- torch

## Quick start
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
2. Open and run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook strokeprednn.ipynb
```

## Notes
- The notebook performs one-hot encoding, scaling, and trains a simple feed-forward network.
- If you add scripts later, document their usage here.
